# 🔲 CSS Loader: Squares Animation

Welcome to my animated squares loader project—built using pure HTML and CSS! Inspired by [this YouTube animation](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/RlFmSQq8IsA), this sleek and minimal preloader gives your site a vibrant, modern touch while content loads in the background.

You can copy this into a new file called `README.md` in your project root, commit it, and push to GitHub.
